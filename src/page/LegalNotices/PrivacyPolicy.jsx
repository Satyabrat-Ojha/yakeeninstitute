                      <h4>Legal Basis for Processing Data</h4>
                      <p>We process your data on the basis of the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>

                            in Section 2 below), and for the purposes mentioned
                            in Section 4 below. It is hereby clarified that we
                            may obtain your consent to collect and use certain

                            by law. Once consent is obtained from the individual
                            to use his or her information for those purposes,
                            Yakeen The Learning Institute has the individual's
                            implied consent to collect or receive any

                            fulfil the same purposes. Express consent will also
                            be obtained if, or when, a new use is identified.
                            Consent may also be implied where a user is given
                            notice and a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of

                            opt-out. Subject to certain exceptions (e.g., the
                            personal information is necessary to provide the
                            service or product, or the withdrawal of consent
                            would frustrate the performance of a legal
                            obligation), individuals can withhold or withdraw
                            their consent for Yakeen The Learning Institute to
